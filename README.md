 Project Overview

The **AI Agri Yield Predictor** project aims to **forecast agricultural crop yield** using various environmental and soil parameters.  
By analyzing datasets such as rainfall, temperature, soil nutrients, and production data, this project helps in improving decision-making for crop planning and sustainable farming.


# Milestone 1 â€“ Data Preprocessing and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This milestone covers the **data collection**, **cleaning**, **integration**, and **exploration** of agricultural datasets.  
The goal is to prepare the raw data for model training in upcoming milestones.

 **Tasks Completed**
- Collected datasets from FAOSTAT, Foodgrains, Oilseeds, and Crop Recommendation sources.  
- Merged multiple datasets into a unified structure.  
- Cleaned data by handling missing values, renaming columns, and removing duplicates.  
- Conducted **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to identify important patterns, relationships, and distributions.
